\chapter{Non Functional Requirements}
\label{nonfunc::doc}\label{nonfunc:non-functional-requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
\label{nonfunc:performance-requirements}

\subsection{Performance}
\label{nonfunc:performance}
The system must be interactive and the delays involved must be less .So in every action-response of the system, there are no immediate delays. In case of opening windows forms, of popping error messages and saving the settings or sessions there is delay much below 2 seconds, In case of opening databases, sorting questions and evaluation there are no delays and the operation is performed in less than 2 seconds for opening ,sorting, computing, posting \textgreater{} 95\% of the files. Also when connecting to the server the delay is based editing on the distance of the 2 systems and the configuration between them so there is high probability that there will be or not a successful connection in less than 20 seconds for sake of good communication.


\subsection{Safety}
\label{nonfunc:safety}
Information transmission should be securely transmitted to server without any changes in information


\subsection{Reliability}
\label{nonfunc:reliability}
As the system provide the right tools for discussion, problem solving it must be made sure that the system is reliable in its operations and for securing the sensitive details.


\section{Software Quality Attributes}
\label{nonfunc:software-quality-attributes}

\subsection{Availability}
\label{nonfunc:availability}
If the internet service gets disrupted while sending information to the server, the information can be send again for verification.


\subsection{Security}
\label{nonfunc:security}
The main security concern is for users account hence proper login mechanism should be used to avoid hacking. The tablet id registration is way to spam check for increasing the security. Hence, security is provided from unwanted use of recognition software.


\subsection{Usability}
\label{nonfunc:usability}
As the system is easy to handle and navigates in the most expected way with no delays. In that case the system program reacts accordingly and transverses quickly between its states.


\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion::doc}\label{conclusion:conclusion}
With the continued evolution in technology, portal is becoming more and more essential now-a-days, where user can freely express their thoughts, ideas and discuss their issues that they are currently facing with the technology, this is where Aakash Portal come in picture ,which provided a platform for Aakash users to discuss their issues that they are facing with the Aakash Tablet, as well as Aakash portal create an online platform which brings developers together and facilitates application development and improvement.
